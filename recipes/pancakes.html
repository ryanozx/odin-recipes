        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 dash salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract in a bowl; stir in the sugar. Whisk in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, combining the batter with just a few strokes to moisten. Leave the lumps.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg and lemon juice together; gently stir into the batter. Refrigerate the batter for at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and grease with the butter. Pour 1/3 cup of batter per pancake into the skillet and cook until bubbles appear on the surface, for about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and brown the other side for 2 more minutes.</li>
        </ol>
